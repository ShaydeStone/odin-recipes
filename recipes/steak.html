    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The New York Strip Steak is a classic cut known for its bold beefy flavor and satisfying chew. With a beautiful marbling of fat and a firm texture, it’s the ideal steak for a quick pan-sear and a luxurious dinner at home. This recipe keeps it simple—just salt, pepper, garlic, butter, and a hot skillet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 New York strip steaks (about 1–1.5 inches thick)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons high smoke point oil (like avocado or canola)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
        <li>2–3 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Take the steaks out of the fridge 30–45 minutes before cooking. This ensures even cooking.</li>
        <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Season both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Don’t be shy—this is your crust!</li>
        <li>Place a heavy skillet (cast iron is best) over high heat. Let it get very hot—about 3–5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add oil to the pan. Carefully place the steaks in the skillet and sear for 3–4 minutes without moving them. Flip and sear the other side for another 3–4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter, garlic, and herbs to the pan. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steaks repeatedly for about 1–2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Check for Doneness. Use a meat thermometer: Rare: 120–125°F, Medium-rare: 130–135°F, Medium: 140–145°F</li>
        <li>Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5–10 minutes. This helps the juices redistribute.</li>
    </ol>
