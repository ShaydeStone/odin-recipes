    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This pasta is rich, creamy, and packed with flavor from fresh garlic and nutty Parmesan cheese. It’s a one-pan wonder that feels indulgent but comes together in under 30 minutes. Perfect as a main dish or a side to grilled chicken or shrimp.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>12 oz fettuccine or pasta of choice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream (or half-and-half for a lighter version)</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add minced garlic and sauté for 1–2 minutes until fragrant (don’t let it brown).</li>
        <li>Pour in the cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and whisk until melted and smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if using.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of reserved pasta water until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Plate the pasta and garnish with chopped parsley and extra Parmesan. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
